## mlb_first_place.ipynb: [Who's in First (place)?](https://www.meninderpurewal.com/data-meandering/whos-in-first)

As of 6/8/2021, they are in first place and I wanted to know, when was the last time this happened?  More generically, for a given date, when was the last time they were in first?  This notebook leverages baseball-reference.com to find the last time the Mets were in first place by date.
