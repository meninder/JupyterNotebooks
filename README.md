# JupyterNotebooks
The purpose of this repo is to host Jupyter notebooks that are generally one off analysis.

## xkcd2435.ipynb
The xkcd comic [2435](https://xkcd.com/2435/) "Geothmetic Mean" entertains us with a function that combines arithmetric mean, geometric mean, and median.  This notebook shows how, given the set of inputs in the comic, one arrives at the function value.

## mlb_first_place.ipynb
I'm a Met fan, which creates an asymmetric skew in memory: the bad seems to stand out more than the good.  As of 6/8/2021, they are in first place and I wanted to know, when was the last time this happened?  More generically, for a given date, when was the last time they were in first?  This notebook leverages baseball-reference.com to find the last time the Mets were in first place by date.
